**Face Recognition Attendance System**

This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System built using the Flet framework and MediaPipe for face detection. It provides a seamless way to manage attendance by leveraging biometric facial recognition for user sign-in and sign-out.

**Key Features**
1. **Real-Time Facial Recognition:** Detect and recognize faces through a live camera feed.
2. **User Registration:** Securely register users by capturing facial data and encrypting personal details.
3. **Attendance Logging:** Automatically record sign-in and sign-out times, with a detailed history.
4. **Admin Controls:** Download attendance logs in CSV format for efficient record-keeping and giving them the monopoly of registering a new user to the system.
5. **Secure Data Management:** Encrypt sensitive information (e.g., fullname, email, and phone number) using cryptography.

**Technologies Used**
1. **Flet Framework:** For building the user interface.
2. **MediaPipe:** For real-time face detection.
3. **OpenCV:** For handling camera inputs and image processing.
4. **Cryptography:** To securely encrypt and decrypt user data.
5. **JSON:** For persistent storage of user data and attendance logs.
6. **Tensorflow:** The framework where the face recognition system is built-upon, the backbone for face recognition.

**Usage**
1. **Register a User:** Capture the userâ€™s face and input their details (name, email, and phone).
2. **Sign In:** Automatically detect and recognize a userâ€™s face to log their attendance.
3. **Sign Out:** Record the userâ€™s sign-out time using facial recognition.
